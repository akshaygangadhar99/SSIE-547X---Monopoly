# SSIE-547X---Monopoly  

## Collaborators  
- Akshay Gangadhar
- Srikanth Iyer
- Amahury J. Lopez-Diaz

## About  
- This is part of the final project for the SSIE-547x Modern Complexity Theory course offered as part of the fall '23 semester for the Systems Science program at SUNY Binghamton (Watson College of Engineering & Applied Science).  
- Contained here, is the code developed to execute multiple simulation runs of Monopoly for an N-player game.
- The methods developed are aptly described within the function definitions themselves.
- The code contains additional functionalities to record round-wise data for each simulation.

## How to Run
Execute the _runSimulation()_ method after specifying the following parameters:
  - M -> Number of simulations
  - N -> Max. number of turns to be simulated (if the game never ends) per simulation
  - n -> Number of players
